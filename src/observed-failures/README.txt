This directory contains details of the failures observed and how to recreate them.

If the input file to recreate the failure is a generated one by one of our scripts,
then the filename will be of the format 's<int>' or 'l<int>' and it will be present 
in the same directory, along with instructions of how it was generated.

Otherwise, the file will be available in the FILE and FILE_backup directories, once
setup.sh has been run in the root directory of this project
