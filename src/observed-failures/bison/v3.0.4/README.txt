Execution commands that lead to hangs (executed from src directory) - 
    "./targets/bison/src/bison observed-failures/bison/v3.0.4/l26"
    "./targets/bison/src/bison observed-failures/bison/v3.0.4/s20"

Cannot find the exact command that generated the files. :(
I believed it was the following command until now but it produces different files now- 
    "python3 generate_argfiles.py --seed 20001 --length=8000 --no-newlines"
